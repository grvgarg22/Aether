						<h2 class="margin-btm">The cost of loosing hand</h2>
						
						<p>The loss of the limb is often associated with high costs incurred by the patient. These are both the obvious physical costs as loss of body parts, as well as mental and financial costs if the patient wants to gain access to a replacement limb.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">Focusing on the financial costs, there are a variety of differently advanced artificial limbs. The amputee can choose between the most primary prosthesis with only grasp function, the cosmetic prosthesis to provide natural look but without any other functions, but also bionic limb with robust design and plenty of grip patterns.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">Although some amputees would like to use more advanced prosthetic options, they use the most primitive ones. The price of the device is related to the advancement of the prosthesis and due to that not everyone is able to afford such a big expense as buying a bionic forearm prosthesis. </p>
						<p class="margin-btm">However, people who would like to use prosthetic options can benefit from special funding and reimbursement programs. Part of the required cost of the prosthesis can be covered by the government reimbursement programme.However it is necessary for patients to cover the other part of the cost which exceeds the total amount financed.</p>
						
						<h5 class="margin-btm">How to receive a reimbursement for the hand prosthesis?</h5>
						<p class="margin-btm">While checking costs of prosthesis a lot of amputees have thoughts if it is possible to reduce the amount of price. Not everyone is able to collect money to buy the exact model of the prosthesis that they dream of. Due to that, there are the questions that come to mind - how to get funds for buying a prosthesis or how to get a reimbursement. Although it seems more as a personal issue to raise funds, getting reimbursement depends on institutions that support people with disabilities.</p>

						<h5 class="margin-btm">Polish way to receive a reimbursement for the prosthesis</h5>
						<p class="margin-btm">Bearing in mind that Aether Biomedical is based in Poznań - a city in Poland, reimbursement for the prosthesis in Poland will be introduced as a one of the main parts. There are 3 ways to receive a reimbursement for artificial upper limb in Poland.</p>

						<p class="margin-btm">1) The first way - NFZ - Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia - National Health Fund</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">To receive a refund for a prosthesis, one must obtain an application for supplying medical devices from a surgeon or orthopedic surgeon, who must then be confirmed by the National Health Fund (NFZ). In the interests of full understanding of the process, the steps necessary to obtain a refund have been specified.</p>
						<p>Step 1: General practitioner has to write a referral to a specialist - surgeon, orthopedist or medical rehabilitation doctor.</p>
						<p>Step 2: Specialist needs to write an application for orthopedic equipment - hand prosthesis - with a specific NFZ code</p>
						<p>Step 3: Provincial branch of the National Health Fund (NFZ), competent for the place of residence has to accept the orthopedic supply application. The applicant can appear in the branch with a document by herself/himself or it can be provided by someone else. It is as well possible to send the document.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">Step 4: Submission of the stamped application to selected orthopedic company and acceptance for the implementation by them.</p>

						<p>Based on the latest data on the financing of medical devices issued by the Ministry of Health (i.e. from last year 2019), the amount financed varies depending on the degree of amputation and the advancement of the prosthesis.</p>
						<p>Due to that the costs are as follows:</p>
						<p>* Cosmetic prosthesis of the hand 800 zlotys</p>
						<p>* Cosmetic prosthesis of the forearm 1200 zlotys</p>
						<p>* Prosthesis of the forearm with working tips 2800 zlotys</p>
						<p>* Cosmetic prosthesis of the arm 2400 zlotys</p>
						<p>* Prosthesis of the arm with working tips 4000 zlotys</p>
						<p>* Cosmetic prosthesis after peeling in the shoulder joint 3000 zlotys,</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">* Prosthesis after peeling in the shoulder joint with working tips 4600 zlotys.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">2) Another way to get a refund in Poland is to contact the Municipal Social Assistance Center or the Family Support Center - Miejskie Centrum Pomocy Społecznej lub Centrum Wsparcia Rodziny - MOPS or PCPR. Application can be submitted at an office specific for the place of residence.</p>

						<p>The main goal of this funds are to equalize life quality and financial support for poorer citizens.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">Due to that, there are special requirements necessary to meet to qualify for this reimbursement programme. The average income from the last 3 months preceding the submission of the application has not exceeded the current income threshold. It is also necessary to submit documents: special application download from the MOPS internet site, declaration about disability, pro-forma invoice from P&O center, NFZ application and income declaration. The amount of funding is up to 150% of the amount of funding from the National Health Fund.</p>

						<p>3) The third way to get a reimbursement for the hand prosthesis in Poland is through a connection to State Fund for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled - PFRON - "Active Local Government'' Program - Państwowy Fundusz Rehabilitacji Osób Niepełnosprawnych.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">MOPS and PCPR distribute the PFRON funds, due to that it is necessary to apply an application with documents in their offices. However, there are some restriction that have to be met. The applicant have to be professionally active (working people, pupils or students) or be in the age of professional activity. It is possible to claim for reimbursement while having a partial inability to work.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">In the assumption of the program, the prosthesis financed in the program is to facilitate the return to professional activity.</p>

						<p>The applicant must provide the documents: special application downloaded from MOPS/PCPR website, certificate from a specialist doctor, valid disability certificate, 2 cost estimates for hand prosthesis from 2 different orthopedic companies and 2 pro-form invoices.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">The maximum funding from PFRON is: *up to 100% of the disabled person's own contribution set in the NFZ price limit, *up to 150% of the sum of the limit amount set by the National Health Fund and the own contribution of the disabled person, if the purchase price is higher than the set limit in the Regulation of the Minister of Health. PCPR specifies the deadlines for submitting and examining applications during a given year and decides on the amount of funding.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">In other European countries the situation of the national healthcare and getting a reimbursement for medical devices are similar. However, if the person decided to try to get a reimbursement it is necessary to check more precisely how the whole process exactly looks like in the chosen country.</p>
						
						<h5 class="margin-btm">Indian way to receive a reimbursement for the prosthesis</h5>
						<p>Another place on the Earth of Aether Biomedical is India and due to that, information about reimbursement in India will be provided.</p>
						<p>Healthcare in India is different than in Poland or in other European countries, it is more universal.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">Bearing in mind polish medical healthcare and ways to receive funds, in India there is a discrepancy in the coverage of the treatment, as well as in the quality of the system. One of the biggest issues due to receiving reimbursement by the healthcare system in India is common lack of adequate coverage.</p>
						<p class="margin-btm">The majority of Indians are not able to cover health insurance due to the cost. To summarize, in India a lot depends on the personal insurance plan of the applicant for reimbursement. It is necessary to provide all of the information to the health insurance manager to receive an ultimate decision about financial support. </p>

						<h5 class="margin-btm">Reimbursement for the prosthesis in other countries</h5>
						<p>If needed information about reimbursement in another country the best option is to find necessary documents on the official website of the Ministry of Health or ask a personal prosthetist.</p>
